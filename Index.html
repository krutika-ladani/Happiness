            <p> Hope you all are doing great, feeling fabulous, and living life to the fullest! 💃🏻 <br>
                Even though we're far away now, our friendship is as strong as ever. 
                We've always been there for each other, laughing and supporting each other through everything. 🫶🏻 
                I miss seeing you all in person. Without all of us together, this city is no longer what it used to be. 🥺 
                Every time when I pass Khushi/Dhwani's house, I can't help but miss 'Us'. <br><br>
                But I know that no matter how far apart we are, we'll always be close in each other's heart.  
                Thank you everyone for being such an amazing friend. 
                I can't wait to see you all again. Let's pledge to meet again just like we used to, no matter where life takes us. ❤️
            </p>

                In a world full of chaos, we find our fun, <br>
                A group of misfits, second to none. <br>
                With jokes and laughter, we paint the town, <br>
                Turning frowns upside down. <br> <br>

                From silly pranks to inside jokes, <br>
                We're a bunch of goofballs, that's no hoax. <br>
                Through thick and thin, we stick like glue, <br>
                A merry band, forever true. <br> <br>

                So here's to us, the crazy crew, <br>
                With hearts of gold and laughter too. <br>
                Together we'll roam, with joy untold, <br>
                For in this friendship, we'll never grow old. <br> <br>

                        I know you're missing your family right now, and that's completely understandable 🤧. It's hard to be away from the people we love the most. But remember, distance doesn't lessen the love and bond you share with them. Every moment you spend apart is just building up to the incredible reunion you'll have when you see them again 😍. <br><br>
    In the meantime, hold on to the beautiful memories and know that they're thinking of you just as much as you're thinking of them 🤗. Stay strong and keep your heart warm with their love. You'll be back together before you know it, and until then, remember they are just a video call away. <br>
                    </p>
                    Sending you a big hug and all my support 💝.

                        Is your name Google? <br>
                        Because you have everything I’ve been searching for. <br><br>

                        Can I follow you home? <br>
                        Because my parents always told me to follow my dreams. <br><br>
                        
                        Do you have a name, or can I call you mine? <br><br>

                        I know you're hurting right now, and it’s so hard to see you like this. But I want you to remember something important: they weren’t worth it. Anyone who can't see how amazing you are doesn’t deserve a place in your heart. You deserve someone who appreciates and values you, someone who recognizes the incredible person you are. This pain won't last forever, and in time, you'll find someone who truly deserves your love.
                    </p>

                    Until then, lean on me 😉. I'm here for you, always 💋! <br><br>
